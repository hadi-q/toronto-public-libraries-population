Notes:
1,2021 and 2016 population
,Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us. As part of this commitment  some population counts of geographic areas are adjusted in order to ensure confidentiality.
,The adjustment to counts of the total population for any dissemination block is controlled to ensure that the population counts for dissemination areas will always be within 5 of the actual values. The adjustment has no impact on the population counts of census divisions and large census subdivisions.

2,Total private dwellings
,Private dwelling refers to a separate set of living quarters with a private entrance either from outside the building or from a common hall  lobby  vestibule or stairway inside the building. The entrance to the dwelling must be one that can be used without passing through the living quarters of some other person or group of persons.

3,Private dwellings occupied by usual residents
,A private dwelling occupied by usual residents refers to a private dwelling in which a person or a group of persons is permanently residing. Also included are private dwellings whose usual residents are temporarily absent on May 11  2021.

4,The category 'Movable dwelling' includes mobile homes and other movable dwellings such as houseboats  recreational vehiclesand railroad cars.

5,A census family is defined as a married couple (with or without children)  a common-law couple (with or without children) or a one-parent family. For more information  refer to theCensus Dictionary: Census family structure.

6,There is no age restriction on children. Includes children living with a grandparent or grandparents without a parent present.

7,Includes foster children.

8,Multigenerational households represent all households where there is at least one person who is both the grandparent of a person in the household and the parent of another person in the same household. They also represent all households where there is at least one person who is both the child of a person in the household and the grandchild of another person in the same household. In previous censuses  multigenerational households were only created based on the former definition  not the latter. As a result  there may be small differences in counts for 2011 and 2016 in archived tables.

9,Excludes multigenerational households.

10,Total income - The sum of certain incomes (in cash and  in some circumstances  in kind) of the statistical unit during a specified reference period. The components used to calculate total income vary between:


    *statistical units of social statistical programs such as persons  private households  census families and economic families;
,
    *statistical units of business statistical programs such as enterprises  companies  establishments and locations;
,
    *statistical units of farm statistical programs such as farm operator and farm family.
,

In the context of persons  total income refers to receipts from certain sources  before income taxes and deductions  during a specified reference period.

In the context of census families  total income refers to receipts from certain sources of all of its family members  before income taxes and deductions  during a specified reference period.

In the context of economic families  total income refers to receipts from certain sources of all of its family members  before income taxes and deductions  during a specified reference period.

In the context of households  total income refers to receipts from certain sources of all household members  before income taxes and deductions  during a specified reference period.

The monetary receipts included are those that tend to be of a regular and recurring nature. Receipts that are included as income are:


    *employment income from wages  salaries  tips  commissions and net income from self-employment (for both unincorporated farm and non-farm activities);
,
    *income from investment sources  such as dividends and interest on bonds  accounts  guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and mutual funds;

,
    *capital gains because they are not by their nature regular and recurring. It is further assumed that they are more relevant to the concept of wealth than the concept of income;

Median income - The median income of a specified group is the amount that divides the income distribution of that group into two halves  i.e.  the incomes of half of the units in that group are below the median  while those of the other half are above the median. Median incomes of families are calculated for all units  whether or not they had income.

Economic family structure - The combination of relatives that comprise a family. Classification on this variable considers the presence or absence of: married spouses or common-law partners; children; and other relatives. For more information  refer to the variable 'economic family structure ' Dictionary  Census of Population  2021.

29,Total income - The sum of certain incomes (in cash and  in some circumstances  in kind) of the statistical unit during a specified reference period. The components used to calculate total income vary between:

After-tax income - Total income less income taxes of the statistical unit during a specified reference period. Income taxes refers to the sum of federal income taxes  provincial and territorial income taxes  less abatement where applicable. Provincial and territorial income taxes include health care premiums in certain jurisdictions. Abatement reduces the federal income taxes payable by persons residing in Quebec or in certain self-governing Yukon First Nation settlement lands.

For the 2021 Census  the reference period for income data is the calendar year 2020  unless otherwise specified.

Average income - Average income of a specified group is calculated by dividing the aggregate income of that group by the number of units in that group. Average incomes of persons not in families are calculated for all units  whether or not they had income.

33,Low-income status - The income situation of the statistical unit in relation to a specific low-income line in a reference year. Statistical units with income that is below the low-income line are considered to be in low income.

For the 2021 Census  the reference period for income data is the calendar year 2020  unless otherwise specified.

Prior to the 2021 Census  the LIM thresholds and the LIM low income statistics were derived and reported for the population residing outside of the territories and off reserve only. It was based on the consideration that the income  prices and expenditure patterns could be quite different in the territories and on reserve  and thus  could make the interpretation of the LIM low-income statistics difficult.

Since the 2016 Census  there were research studies that analyzed the feasibility of defining LIM thresholds that include the population living in the territories and on reserve  and examined the aspects that should be considered when interpreting low-income statistics based on this definition.  With the guidance and support of such research  the 2021 Census expanded the coverage of the LIM concept to all regions in Canada  making it the only low-income concept that is applicable to the population living in the territories and on reserve.

Low-income measure  after tax (LIM-AT) - The Low-income measure  after tax  refers to a fixed percentage (50%) of median-adjusted after-tax income of private households. The household after-tax income is adjusted by an equivalence scale to take economies of scale into account. This adjustment for different household sizes reflects the fact that a household's needs increase  but at a decreasing rate  as the number of members increases.

Using data from the 2021 Census of Population  the line applicable to a household is defined as half the Canadian median of the adjusted household after-tax income multiplied by the square root of household size. The median is determined based on all persons in private households where low-income concepts are applicable. Thresholds for specific household sizes are presented in Table 2.4 Low-income measures thresholds (LIM-AT and LIM-BT) for private households of Canada  2020  Dictionary  Census of Population  2021.

When the unadjusted after-tax income of household pertaining to a person falls below the threshold applicable to the person based on household size  the person is considered to be in low income according to LIM-AT. Since the LIM-AT threshold and household income are unique within each household  low-income status based on LIM-AT can also be reported for households.

Low-income cut-offs  after tax (LICO-AT) - The Low-income cut-offs  after tax refers to an income threshold  defined using 1992 expenditure data  below which economic families or persons not in economic families would likely have devoted a larger share of their after-tax income than average to the necessities of food  shelter and clothing. More specifically  the thresholds represented income levels at which these families or persons were expected to spend 20 percentage points or more of their after-tax income than average on food  shelter and clothing. These thresholds have been adjusted to current dollars using the all-items Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The LICO-AT has 35 cut-offs varying by seven family sizes and five different sizes of area of residence to account for economies of scale and potential differences in cost of living in communities of different sizes. These thresholds are presented in Table 2.5 Low-income cut-offs  after tax (LICO-AT - 1992 base) for economic families and persons not in economic families  2020  Dictionary  Census of Population  2021.

When the after-tax income of an economic family member or a person not in an economic family falls below the threshold applicable to the person  the person is considered to be in low income according to LICO-AT. Since the LICO-AT threshold and family income are unique within each economic family  low-income status based on LICO-AT can also be reported for economic families.

Prevalence of low income - The proportion or percentage of units whose income falls below a specified low-income line.

34,Economic family after-tax income decile group - The economic family income decile group provides a rough ranking of the economic situation of a person based on his or her relative position in the Canadian distribution of the adjusted after-tax income of economic families for all persons in private households.

Using data from the 2021 Census of Population  the population in private households is sorted according to its adjusted after-tax family income and then divided into 10 equal groups each containing 10% of the population. The decile cut-points are the levels of adjusted after-tax family income that define the 10 groups.

For the 2021 Census  the reference period for income data is the calendar year 2020  unless otherwise specified.

35,The Gini coefficient  or Gini index  is a measure of inequality that indicates how equally income is distributed for a given population. It measures how much an income distribution deviates from perfect equality. Values of the Gini coefficient can range from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates that income is equally divided among the population  with all units receiving exactly the same amount of income. At the opposite extreme  a Gini coefficient of 1 denotes a perfectly unequal distribution  where one unit has all of the income in the economy. 

For the census  Gini coefficients are calculated for three types of adjusted household incomemarket income  total income and after tax income. Adjusted income is computed by dividing the household income by a factor equal to the square root of the household size (known as the equivalence scale). This adjustment for different household sizes takes into account economies of scale. It reflects the fact that the needs of a household increase  but at a decreasing rate  as the number of members increases.
 
The P90/P10 ratio is a measure of inequality. It is the ratio of the 90th and the 10th percentile of the adjusted household after-tax income. The 90th percentile means 90% of the population has income that falls below this threshold. The 10th percentile means 10% of the population has income that falls below this threshold.
 
36,Knowledge of official languagesrefers to whether the person can conduct a conversation in English only  French only  in both or in neither language. For a child who has not yet learned to speak  this includes languages that the child is learning to speak at home.
For more information on language variables  including information on their classifications  the questions from which they are derived  data quality and their comparability with other sources of data  please refer to the Languages Reference Guide  Census of Population  2021.

37,First official language spokenrefers to the first official language (English or French) spoken by the person.
For more information on language variables  including information on their classifications  the questions from which they are derived  data quality and their comparability with other sources of data  please refer to the Languages Reference Guide  Census of Population  2021.

38,Mother tongue refers to the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the person at the time the data was collected. If the person no longer understands the first language learned  the mother tongue is the second language learned. For a person who learned more than one language at the same time in early childhood  the mother tongue is the language this person spoke most often at home before starting school. The person has more than one mother tongue only if they learned these languages at the same time  and still understands them. For a child who has not yet learned to speak  the mother tongue is the language spoken most often to this child at home. A child who has not yet learned to speak has more than one mother tongue only if these languages are spoken to them equally often so that the child learns these languages at the same time.

41,Language spoken most often at home refers to the language the person speaks most often at home at the time of data collection. A person can report more than one language as "spoken most often at home" if the languages are spoken equally often.
For a person who lives alone  the language spoken most often at home is the language in which they feel most comfortable. For a child who has not yet learned to speak  this is the language spoken most often to the child at home. Where more than one language is spoken to the child  the language spoken most often at home is the language spoken most often. If more than one language is spoken equally often to the child  then these languages are included here.

45,This category includes persons who identify as First Nations (North American Indian)  Mtis and/or Inuk (Inuit) and/or those who report being Registered or Treaty Indians (that is  registered under the Indian Act of Canada)  and/or those who report having membership in a First Nation or Indian band.

46,This category includes persons who identify as only one Indigenous group  that is First Nations (North American Indian)  Mtis or Inuk (Inuit).

47,This category includes persons who identify as any two or all three of the following: First Nations (North American Indian)  Mtis and/or Inuk (Inuit).

48,This category includes persons who do not identify as First Nations (North American Indian)  Mtis or Inuk (Inuit) but who report having Registered or Treaty Indian status and/or Membership in a First Nation or Indian band.

49,Registered or Treaty Indian statusrefers to whether or not a person is a Registered or Treaty Indian. Registered Indians are persons who are registered under the Indian Act of Canada. Treaty Indians are persons who belong to a First Nation or Indian band that signed a treaty with the Crown. Registered or Treaty Indians are sometimes also called Status Indians.

50,Tenure refers to whether the household owns or rents their private dwelling. The private dwelling may be situated on rented or leased land or be part of a condominium. A household is considered to own their dwelling if some member of the household owns the dwelling even if it is not fully paid for  for example if there is a mortgage or some other claim on it. A household is considered to rent their dwelling if no member of the household owns the dwelling. A household is considered to rent that dwelling even if the dwelling is provided without cash rent or at a reduced rent  or if the dwelling is part of a cooperative.
For historical and statutory reasons  shelter occupancy on Indian reserves or settlements does not lend itself to the usual classification by standard tenure categories. Therefore  a special category  'dwelling provided by the local government  First Nation or Indian band ' has been created for census purposes.

51,Condominium status refers to whether the private dwelling is part of a condominium development. A condominium is a residential complex in which dwellings are owned individually while land and common elements are held in joint ownership with others.

52,Bedrooms refers to rooms in a private dwelling that are designed mainly for sleeping purposes even if they are now used for other purposes  such as guest rooms and television rooms. Also included are rooms used as bedrooms now  even if they were not originally built as bedrooms  such as bedrooms in a finished basement. Bedrooms exclude rooms designed for another use during the day such as dining rooms and living rooms even if they may be used for sleeping purposes at night. By definition  one-room private dwellings such as bachelor or studio apartments have zero bedrooms.

53,Rooms refers to enclosed areas within a private dwelling which are finished and suitable for year round living. The number of rooms in a private dwelling includes kitchens  bedrooms and finished rooms in the attic or basement. The number of rooms in a private dwelling excludes bathrooms  halls  vestibules and rooms used solely for business purposes. Partially divided rooms are considered to be separate rooms if they are considered as such by the respondent (e.g.  L-shaped dining-room and living-room arrangements).

54,Number of persons per room - Refers to an indicator of the level of crowding in a private dwelling. It is calculated by dividing the number of persons in the household by the number of rooms in the dwelling.

55,Housing suitability refers to whether a private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is  whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms  as calculated using the NOS.
'Housing suitability' assesses the required number of bedrooms for a household based on the age  sex  and relationships among household members. An alternative variable  'persons per room ' considers all rooms in a private dwelling and the number of household members.
Housing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies.

56,Period of construction refers to the period in time during which the building or dwelling was originally constructed.
This refers to the period in which the building was completed  not the time of any later remodeling  additions or conversions.
For properties having multiple residential structures  this refers to the period in which the most recent structure was completed.

57,Includes data up to May 11  2021.

58,Dwelling condition refers to whether the dwelling is in need of repairs. This does not include desirable remodelling or additions.

59,Refers to whether or not a person residing in the household is responsible for paying the rent  or the mortgage  or the taxes  or the electricity or other services or utilities. Where a number of people may contribute to the payments  more than one person in the household may be identified as a household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making such payments  the reference person is identified by default.

60,Primary household maintainer - The first person in the household identified as someone who pays the rent  or the mortgage  or the taxes  or the electricity or other services or utilities for the dwelling. When more than one member of the household contributes to the payments  the first person listed is chosen as the primary household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making any such payments  the first person listed is selected by default.
The order of the persons in a household is determined by the order in which they are listed on the questionnaire. Generally  an adult is listed first followed  if applicable  by their spouse or common-law partner and then by their children. The order does not necessarily correspond to the proportion of household payments made by each person.

61,Shelter-cost-to-income ratio - Refers to the proportion of average total income of household which is spent on shelter costs.
Shelter-cost-to-income ratio is calculated for private households  who reported a total household income greater than zero.
Private households located on an agricultural operation that is operated by a member of the household  and households who reported a zero or negative total household income are excluded.
The relatively high shelter-costs-to-household income ratios for some households may have resulted from the difference in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is 2021  while household total income is reported for the year 2020. As well  for some households  the 2020 household total income may represent income for only part of a year.
For more information on household total income or shelter costs  refer to the Census Dictionary: Total income and Shelter cost.

62,Acceptable housing refers to whether a household meets each of the three indicator thresholds established by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation for housing adequacy  suitability and affordability.Housing indicator thresholds are defined as follows:
    *Adequate housing is reported by their residents as not requiring any major repairs.
,    *Affordable housing has shelter costs equal to less than 30% of total before-tax household income.
,    *Suitable housing has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS)  conceived by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and provincial and territorial representatives.
,Acceptable housing identifies which thresholds the household falls below  if any. Housing that is adequate in condition  suitable in size and affordable is considered to be acceptable.
Households below and above the thresholds are based on the indicators for which individual households can be assessed. Farm and on-reserve households whose housing does not meet either or both of the suitability and adequacy thresholds are counted in the total of households below the thresholds. Farm and on-reserve households who live in housing that meets both the suitability and adequacy thresholds are counted in the total of households above the thresholds (even though it is not possible to assess housing affordability for these households). Farm households and on-reserve households cannot be assessed for housing affordability because the concept is not applicable.
Housing affordability is assessed for owner and tenant households with household total income greater than zero in non-farm  non-reserve private dwellings.

63,Core housing need refers to whether a private household's housing falls below at least one of the indicator thresholds for housing adequacy  affordability or suitability  and would have to spend 30% or more of its total before-tax income to pay the median rent of alternative local housing that is acceptable (attains all three housing indicator thresholds). Housing indicator thresholds are defined as follows: Adequate housing is reported by their residents as not requiring any major repairs. Affordable housing has shelter costs equal to less than 30% of total before-tax household income. Suitable housing has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS)  conceived by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and provincial and territorial representatives. Only private  non-farm  non-reserve and owner- or renter-households with incomes greater than zero and shelter-cost-to-income ratios less than 100% are assessed for 'core housing need.' Non-family households with at least one maintainer aged 15 to 29 attending school are considered not to be in 'core housing need' regardless of their housing circumstances. Attending school is considered a transitional phase  and low incomes earned by student households are viewed as being a temporary condition.

64,Presence of mortgage payments refers to whether an owner household makes regular mortgage or loan payments for their dwelling.

65,Shelter cost refers to the average monthly total of all shelter expenses paid by households.
Shelter costs for owner households include  where applicable  mortgage payments  property taxes and condominium fees  along with the costs of electricity  heat  water and other municipal services. For renter households  shelter costs include  where applicable  the rent and the costs of electricity  heat  water and other municipal services. For households living in a dwelling provided by the local government  First Nation or Indian band  shelter costs include  where applicable  the monthly use or occupancy payment and the costs of electricity  heat  water and other municipal services.

66,Value (owner estimated) refers to the dollar amount expected by the owner if the asset were to be sold.
In the context of dwelling  it refers to the value of the entire dwelling  including the value of the land it is on and of any other structure  such as a garage  which is on the property. If the dwelling is located in a building which contains several dwellings  or a combination of residential and business premises  all of which the household owns  the value is estimated as a portion of the market value that applies only to the dwelling in which the household resides.

67,Subsidized housing refers to whether a renter household lives in a dwelling that is subsidized. Subsidized housing includes rent geared to income  social housing  public housing  government-assisted housing  non-profit housing  rent supplements and housing allowances.

68,'Indigenous ancestry' refers to whether a person has ancestry associated with the Indigenous peoples of Canada  that is  First Nations (North American Indian)  Mtis  and/or Inuit. Aboriginal peoples (referred to here as Indigenous peoples) of Canada are defined in the Constitution Act  1982  Section 35 (2) as including the Indian  Inuit and Mtis peoples of Canada. The term 'Aboriginal' has been replaced with the updated term of 'Indigenous' when referring to individuals who identify themselves as First Nations people  Mtis and/or Inuit.
